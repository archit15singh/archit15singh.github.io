# My Reading List and Why

Over the past few years, I’ve found myself at the intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, and cutting-edge AI engineering. As someone who believes deeply in first-principles thinking, I realized I needed a coherent roadmap, a decade-long syllabus, if you will, that would guide both my intellectual growth and practical skill building. Instead of randomly picking books, I asked myself: **What are the irreducible concepts I must master in epistemology, symbolic systems, cognition, memory, AI, cognitive systems, human-AI augmentation, and large-scale engineering?** The answer became this reading list.

Below, I explain the meta-purpose behind this journey, then break down each domain into its core pillars and list the highest-impact books that will serve as stepping stones over the next ten years.

---

## Why I’m Doing This

1. **Clarify My Intellectual Trajectory**
   I often remind myself: “Don’t accept surface-level explanations.” Whether I’m debugging a distributed system or diving into memory architectures for AI agents, I need to know why things work at a fundamental level. This reading list isn’t just a bibliography, it’s a scaffold that ensures every book I read builds on the ones before it.

2. **Align With Long-Term Goals**
   I’m targeting Stanford’s Symbolic Systems program and simultaneously leading AI-powered infrastructure projects. That means I need fluency in philosophical concepts like “justified belief” and hands-on expertise in deploying memory-augmented LLM pipelines. This dual pursuit of theory and practice shapes how I sequence these books.

3. **Bridge Theory and Practice**
   By approaching each field from first principles, I’ll see how epistemology informs probabilistic reasoning in AI or how cognitive-science insights shape my design of working-memory modules. I don’t want to treat theory and engineering as separate silos, I want them to feed into each other.

4. **Create an Executable Learning Plan**
   A decade seems long, but it can fly by if you wander aimlessly. By the end of year one, I should know the essentials of epistemology and basic symbolic computation. By year five, I’ll be integrating cognitive architectures with production-grade AI pipelines. By year ten, my hope is to ruminate on how self-reflexive AI agents can model their own “beliefs” and “memories.”

## 1. Epistemology: Laying the Foundation for “Knowing”

**First Principles:**

* **Knowledge vs. Belief vs. Justification:** What distinguishes “knowing” from merely “believing”? How do we justify our claims?
* **Sources of Knowledge:** Empiricism (sense data), Rationalism (logical inference), Pragmatism (utility), Coherentism (network of beliefs).
* **Limits of Knowledge:** Skepticism (can we know anything at all?), fallibilism (our beliefs can always be mistaken), contextualism (knowledge claims shift with context).
* **Epistemic Norms:** How do we evaluate evidence? When is a belief “justified”? How do we handle defeaters and counterexamples?

**My Ten-Year Book Sequence:**

1. **Bertrand Russell – *The Problems of Philosophy* (1912)**
   An accessible primer on “what is knowledge?” and why skepticism isn’t just a parlor game. Russell’s clarity lays the groundwork before diving into denser analyses.

2. **Robert Audi – *An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge* (2003)**
   A systematic, classroom-style survey of belief, justification, and sources of knowledge. This text cements my grasp of key terminology and contrasts major schools of thought.

3. **Timothy Williamson – *Knowledge and Its Limits* (2000)**
   Challenges the classical “justified true belief” model, treating knowledge as a basic mental state. Williamson’s arguments push me to confront contemporary debates head-on.

4. **Jonathan Dancy & Ernest Sosa (eds.) – *Epistemology: Classic Problems and Contemporary Responses* (2010)**
   A curated anthology of landmark papers, Gettier, Goldman, Nozick, that each reframe a central problem. Reading them slowly, I’ll trace how foundational debates evolved.

5. **John Greco & Ernest Sosa (eds.) – *The Blackwell Guide to Epistemology* (1999)**
   Surveys subfields like social epistemology, virtue epistemology, and reliabilism. After Audi and Williamson, this volume shows how modern branches branched out.

6. **Abrol Fairweather & Linda Zagzebski (eds.) – *Virtue Epistemology: Essays on Epistemic Virtue and Responsibility* (1998)**
   Focuses on intellectual character traits, humility, curiosity, and how they shape knowledge production. This helps me connect theory to everyday inquiry.

7. **Bimal Krishna Matilal – *Philosophical Issues in Classical Indian Epistemology* (1986)**
   Broadens my perspective with non-Western pramāṇa theory: perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), testimony (śabda). I’ll learn alternative conceptions of knowledge.

---

## 2. Symbolic Systems: Understanding Language, Logic, and Computation

**First Principles:**

* **Symbolic Representation:** How do discrete tokens, words, logical predicates, neural activations, encode meaning?
* **Computation Over Symbols:** The Church-Turing thesis, automata theory, and the notion that “cognition is computation.”
* **Language as Structured Symbols:** Syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; generative grammars (Chomsky) versus usage-based models.
* **Cognition via Symbol Manipulation:** Production systems (ACT-R, SOAR) and mental architectures that simulate symbol processing.
* **Interdisciplinary Fusion:** Blending philosophy, linguistics, computer science, psychology, and neuroscience into a cohesive framework.

**My Ten-Year Book Sequence:**

   Introduces generative grammar and formalizes how a finite set of rules can produce infinite sentences. Essential for modeling human language symbolically.

2. **Marvin Minsky – *Society of Mind* (1986)**
   Argues that mind emerges from interactions of simple agents. It bridges symbolic and connectionist views and shows how modular subunits create higher-level behavior.

3. **Michael Sipser – *Introduction to the Theory of Computation* (2nd ed., 2005)**
   Covers automata, formal languages, and Turing machines, ground zero for understanding “what can be computed.” Necessary before tackling computational models of cognition.

4. **Jay Friedenberg & Gordon Silverman – *Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Science of the Mind* (3rd ed., 2017)**
   A broad survey of psychology, linguistics, AI, and neuroscience. It reveals how symbolic-systems thinkers integrate multiple perspectives.

5. **Daniel Solow – *How to Read and Do Proofs* (2012)**
   Teaches me to parse dense mathematical arguments and construct my own proofs. If I’m going to engage with formal semantics or computational complexity, these tools are indispensable.

6. **Ludwig Wittgenstein – *Philosophical Investigations* (1953)**
   Challenges the notion that meaning reduces to formal rule-following. Wittgenstein’s thought experiments force me to question how symbols “mean” anything in real life.

7. **John Haugeland (ed.) – *Mind Design II: Philosophy, Psychology, Artificial Intelligence* (1997)**
   A collection of essays on “designing” a mind in theory and practice. It aligns closely with Stanford’s Symbolic Systems teaching, weaving philosophy, AI, and psychology into a cohesive narrative.

## 3. Artificial Intelligence: From Search to Deep Learning

**First Principles:**

* **Search & Optimization:** Many intelligent behaviors reduce to exploring a state space guided by heuristics.
* **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning:** Symbolic (logic, frames) vs. subsymbolic (neural embeddings); how we encode information.
* **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Classical statistical models → representation learning → deep networks.
* **Probabilistic Inference:** Bayesian networks, Markov decision processes, modeling uncertainty in real environments.
* **Reinforcement Learning & Planning:** Agents learn via rewards or plan via tree search; the tension between model-based and model-free approaches.
* **Embodiment & Robotics:** Physical agents interacting with a world need perception, control, and real-time learning.

**My Ten-Year Book Sequence:**

1. **Stuart Russell & Peter Norvig – *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (4th ed., 2020)**
   The canonical AI textbook. I’ll read it in sequence: search → logic → probabilistic models → learning → RL → robotics, building from basics to sophistication.

2. **Christopher Bishop – *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* (2006)**
   Focuses on probabilistic graphical models, kernel methods, and the EM algorithm. I need this statistical foundation before delving into neural networks.

3. **Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, & Aaron Courville – *Deep Learning* (2016)**
   Provides a comprehensive overview of neural architectures, optimization, and theory. Reading this after Bishop sharpens my understanding of how classical methods evolved into deep nets.

4. **Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, & Dieter Fox – *Probabilistic Robotics* (2005)**
   Embodied AI: SLAM, particle filters, and Kalman filters. If I ever build real-world agents, this book will be indispensable.

5. **Richard Sutton & Andrew Barto – *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* (2nd ed., 2018)**
   The definitive text on RL: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, TD learning, function approximation. Crucial for constructing memory-augmented agents that solve sequential tasks.

6. **David Barber – *Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning* (2012)**
   Delves deeper into variational inference, sampling, and Bayesian methods. It complements probabilistic chapters in Russell & Norvig and Bishop.

7. **Toby Segaran – *Programming Collective Intelligence* (2007)**
   A hands-on guide to building recommenders, clustering algorithms, and classifiers in Python. I’ll use it to prototype quick, tangible demos, bridging theory and practice.

## 4. Cognition: How Minds Process Information

**First Principles:**

* **Information Processing Model:** The brain is a system that takes input (perception), transforms it (attention, working memory), and outputs decisions or actions.
* **Modularity vs. Distributed Processing:** Are cognitive functions housed in specialized modules or emerging from distributed networks?
* **Marr’s Tri-Level Analysis:** Studying tasks at the computational (what problem is being solved?), algorithmic (how is it solved?), and implementational (how does neural hardware implement it?) levels.
* **Mental Representations:** Symbolic vs. connectionist, mental imagery vs. conceptual schemas.
* **Decision-Making & Heuristics:** How humans choose under bounded rationality, dual-process theories (System 1 vs. System 2).

**My Ten-Year Book Sequence:**

1. **Michael Eysenck & Mark Keane – *Cognitive Psychology: A Student’s Handbook* (7th ed., 2015)**

   A modern, experiment-driven account of memory, attention, language, and problem solving. Its up-to-date findings guide my understanding of how to build AI that aligns with human tendencies.

6. **Gary Klein – *Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions* (1998)**
   Examines real-world experts (firefighters, pilots) making split-second decisions. If my future agents need to operate under stress, Klein’s work teaches how humans succeed, or fail, in critical scenarios.

7. **Michael S. Gazzaniga (ed.) – *The Cognitive Neurosciences* (6th ed., 2018)**
   An anthology on neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes: attention networks, working-memory circuits, decision-making pathways. I’ll use it as a reference whenever I delve into brain-inspired approaches.

---

## 5. Memory: From Molecules to Minds

**First Principles:**

* **Encoding → Storage → Retrieval:** The stages of memory: input gets held in working memory, consolidates into long-term storage, and later gets retrieved.
* **Long-Term Memory Types:** Declarative (episodic vs. semantic) vs. nondeclarative (procedural, priming).
* **Neural Mechanisms:** Hippocampus vs. neocortex, synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD), and how memories stabilize over time.
* **Working Memory Models:** Baddeley’s multicomponent model, phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, central executive.

   Combines theory with practical applications (e.g., spaced repetition). I’ll mine it for strategies (mnemonics, retrieval practice) that inform how to manage retention in large contexts.

5. **John O’Keefe & Lynn Nadel – *The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map* (1978)**
   Introduces place cells and spatial memory. This work inspires me to think about embedding “episodic context” in an agent’s memory system.

6. **Mark Bear, Barry Connors, & Michael Paradiso – *Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior* (2nd ed., 2006)**
   Integrates molecular/cellular mechanisms with overt behavior. I’ll align my ML architectures (e.g., synaptic-like weight updates) with real neural processes.

7. **Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, & Mark A. McDaniel – *Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning* (2014)**
   Distills memory research into practical strategies (retrieval practice, spacing). Since I need to internalize dozens of books over ten years, I’ll apply these techniques to retain and interleave concepts effectively.

* **Reliability & Resilience:** Fault tolerance, redundancy, circuit breakers, backpressure, chaos engineering, design systems that survive unexpected failures.
* **Scalability Patterns:** Horizontal vs. vertical scaling, the CAP theorem, partitioning strategies, caching layers, load balancing.
* **Observability & Feedback Loops:** Logging, metrics, tracing, how to detect issues early and diagnose them quickly.
* **Trade-Off Analysis:** Consistency vs. availability, performance vs. maintainability, specialization vs. generality.

**My Ten-Year Book Sequence:**

1. **Andrew Hunt & David Thomas – *The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery* (20th Anniversary ed., 2019)**
   Timeless principles of software craftsmanship. Each short chapter is an actionable lesson that will shape my coding habits from day one.

2. **Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, & John Vlissides – *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* (1994)**

## Integrating Everything Over Ten Years

Rather than treating these fields as isolated silos, the real power emerges when I **juxtapose** them. For example:

* Skimming Baddeley’s *Working Memory* alongside Gershon’s algorithms in Bishop’s *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* will sharpen my sense of how capacity limits in human cognition inform bounded-resource AI agents.
* Studying Williamson (epistemology) and then engaging with Bishop (probabilistic ML) will reveal how **theory of knowledge** underpins **Bayesian modeling**, what counts as “justified belief” when a Bayesian network updates its posterior.
* Combining Clark’s *Supersizing the Mind* (extended-mind theory) with Wolpaw & Wolpaw’s *Brain-Computer Interfaces* will help me design AI-powered augmentations that feel like natural extensions of the human user.
* Re-reading “Design Patterns” and “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” in Year 7 with fresh eyes, after I’ve internalized “The Extended Mind”, will let me question how domain-specific software patterns obscure or reveal underlying cognitive assumptions.

Hence, after internalizing foundational texts (Years 1–4), I’ll begin **rereading**, this time from an integrative stance:

* **Year 5:** Revisit *AI: A Modern Approach* alongside *Cognitive Psychology: A Student’s Handbook*, annotating where symbolic planners parallel human problem-solving.
* **Year 6–7:** Reread *Design Patterns* and *Clean Code* with insights from *Philosophical Investigations*, questioning how our abstractions map onto real-world human intuitions.
* **Years 8–9:** Reexamine *Site Reliability Engineering* alongside *The Cognitive Neurosciences*, exploring how production-grade observability mirrors human metacognition.
* **Year 10:** Reflect on Clark’s *Natural-Born Cyborgs* and Hayles’ *How We Became Posthuman*, synthesizing an outlook on future AI-human integration in light of everything I’ve learned.

---

### How I’ll Stay on Track

1. **Annotate and Summarize:** After every chapter, I’ll write a one-page “key principles” summary, note any questions raised, and jot down “potential applications” to keep concepts active in my mind.
2. **Monthly “Bridge Notes”:** Every four weeks, I’ll draw explicit connections between recent readings. For example:

   * “How does Baddeley’s model of working memory inform feature selection strategies in Bishop’s PRML?”
   * “What does *The Extended Mind* reveal about building BCI systems covered in Wolpaw & Wolpaw’s book?”
3. **Hands-On Projects:** Each year, I’ll commit to at least one side project that applies my learnings, whether building a toy ACT-R-inspired cognitive architecture in Python, prototyping a memory-augmented RL agent, or designing a BCI demo that translates motor imagery into simple commands.
4. **Spaced Review:** I’ll use strategies from *Make It Stick*, spaced practice, interleaving, self-testing, to ensure I retain and integrate core ideas rather than merely “consuming.”
5. **Yearly Reflection:** At each anniversary of starting this journey, I’ll revisit my initial notes and reflect: Which concepts still feel fuzzy? Which books need a second reading? Which new questions have emerged?

## Final Thoughts

By following this structured, first-principles–based roadmap, I aim to become the “frontier engineer” and “thought leader” I envision, someone who seamlessly navigates between epistemology, symbolic systems, cognitive science, memory research, AI, human augmentation, and production-grade engineering. Over the next decade, this reading list will be my compass, ensuring that my learning is deep, integrated, and directly applicable to both research and real-world impact.

It’s not just a list of books; it’s a manifesto for continuous, intentional growth. Every time I pick up a volume, whether it’s Russell challenging my assumptions about knowledge, Clark reshaping how I think about tools, or Kleppmann revealing the internals of distributed logs, I’ll remember **why** I’m here: to build systems that think, remember, and adapt at the level of a thinking organism, and to do so with philosophical rigor, cognitive insight, and engineering excellence.
