# My Reading List for the Next 10 Years and Why

Over the past few years, I’ve found myself at the intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, and AI engineering. As a firm believer in first-principles thinking, I recognized the need for a coherent, decade-long roadmap to guide my intellectual growth and practical skill-building. Instead of random selections, I asked myself: **What are the irreducible concepts I must master in epistemology, symbolic systems, cognition, memory, AI, cognitive systems, human-AI augmentation, and large-scale engineering?** The result became this curated reading list.

## Why This Journey?

1. **Clarify My Intellectual Trajectory**: Understanding fundamental concepts ensures depth rather than surface-level knowledge.
2. **Align With Long-Term Goals**: Aiming for Stanford’s Symbolic Systems program while leading practical AI infrastructure projects.
3. **Bridge Theory and Practice**: Integrating philosophical theory directly into AI engineering.
4. **Create an Executable Learning Plan**: Establish clear milestones to track progress and integration over ten years.

## Integration Over a Decade

By interleaving these texts, I'll connect epistemology to AI, cognition to engineering, and theory to practice, achieving deep, integrative knowledge. Each book is not an isolated read but part of a broader cognitive tapestry I'll weave intentionally.

Through annotation, monthly synthesis, hands-on projects, spaced review, and annual reflection, I'll ensure I internalize and apply this knowledge effectively.

Ultimately, this reading list isn’t just about intellectual curiosity—it’s my manifesto for intentional, integrated, lifelong learning, shaping me into the systems thinker and AI engineer I aim to become.
